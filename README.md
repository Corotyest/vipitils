# Utilities for lua-vips

This is a small collection of utility functions I find useful when working with VIPS.


## Installation

Get it from [lit](https://luvit.io/lit.html#vips-utils) using

```
lit install RiskoZoSlovenska/vips-utils
```

Coming to [luarocks](https://luarocks.org/) soon.


At the moment, you are required to obtain a copy of either [lit-vips](https://github.com/Bilal2453/lit-vips) or [lua-vips](https://github.com/libvips/lua-vips/tree/master) yourself for the library to work.


## TODO:
* Tests
* Docs
* Publish to luarocks
* Support for more filters
