## Utilities for the image processing module: `lit-vips`.

*Best known as lua-vips*.<br>
;  I only edited a little of the module.<br>
  "This is a small collection of utility functions I find useful when working with VIPS".

## Installation

Get it from [lit](https://luvit.io/lit.html#vips-utils) using

```
lit install Corotyest/vipitils
```

At the moment, you are required to obtain a copy of either [lit-vips](https://github.com/Bilal2453/lit-vips) or [lua-vips](https://github.com/libvips/lua-vips/tree/master) yourself for the library to work.


### TO-DO:
* Tests <br>
  Done but not uploaded.
* Docs <br>
  Medium commented into `vipitils`.
* Support for more filters <br>
  I personally thinks this is pretty much.
